<h2> My Selected Web Host </h2>
<p>
<b>Advantage</b>
There are many advantages to the web host that I chose. The first advantage is that it free for me, because it belongs to my brother-in-law, who is a programmer. Another advantage would be that it has really good personal tech support. I have been currently using github io for a free web host for other web development classes, but they do not support PHP, so I needed a host that did. The last advantage would be that I had to learn more in order to get it to in working order. The major thing I learned about was SCP. 
<br>
<b>Disadvantage</b>
One of the disadvantages of the web host that I chose is that it could crash at any time and would leave my work and assignments inaccessible. My brother-in-law would have to fix it for me. Even though he is very reliable, he is only one person.
